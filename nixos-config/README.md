# NixOS Configurations

## Usage
I use [nh](https://github.com/viperML/nh) for running most nixos commands.  eg.
```sh
nh os switch
```

## Todo
- Document instructions to bootstrap from fresh installation
  - eg. git clone to `~/.dotfiles` then running command
  - Any manual setup steps.  For example fetching SSH keys from a secret store
- Break things up into modules.  I'm just getting a barebones working set up for my laptop initially though
